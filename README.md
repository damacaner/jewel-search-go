Wont gonna say shit, spent quite a bit of time on this. Path of Exile Timeless Jewel seed searching tool, only works on command line but exports results to seeds.txt.

Enter the notable size you want to search, enter the notables, enter the Lethal Pride mod you want to search, but without spaces and %'s like write "base_stun_threshold_reduction_+%" like this "basestunthresholdreduction" program will calculate and give you a seed in seeds.txt.


Will update with Elegant Hubris, but as I said I just posted this for people want to build a search engine like this in Go, so they could take my code and build something better.
